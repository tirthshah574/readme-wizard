## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher.  ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get `readme-creator` up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd readme-creator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:** (See 🔑 Environment Variables)

4.  **Run the application:**

    While this program does not provide a command-line interface, the exact execution will require knowing the exact workings.  The following is hypothetical.

    ```bash
    node index.js <arguments-here>
    ```
    *Replace `<arguments-here>` with the appropriate arguments for your use case.*  Check the `package.json` or the source code for specific CLI arguments.

## 🔑 API Key Setup

The tool requires a Google AI (Gemini) API key. You can provide it in several ways:

1. **Command Line Flag:**
   ```bash
   readme-wizard --api-key "your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Environment Variable:**
   Create a `.env` file in your project or set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. **Interactive Prompt:**
   If no API key is provided, the tool will prompt you to enter it and optionally save it for future use.

4. **Saved Configuration:**
   If you choose to save your API key, it will be stored in `~/.readme-wizard/config.json`.
   To clear saved configuration:
   ```bash
   readme-wizard --clear-config
   ```

To get an API key, visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

**Note:** Replace `your_google_api_key` and `your_huggingface_api_key` with your actual API keys.  Ensure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commit of secrets.

## 📦 Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

*   `@google/genai`: For interacting with Google AI models.
*   `@huggingface/inference`: For using Hugging Face Inference API.
*   `chalk`: For adding colors to the console output.
*   `commander`: For building command-line interfaces.
*   `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   `glob`: For matching file paths using wildcard patterns.
*   `inquirer`: For creating interactive command-line prompts.
*   `node-fetch`: For making HTTP requests.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Issue:**  `Error: Cannot find module '...'`

**Solution:**  Ensure you have installed all dependencies by running `npm install`.  If the issue persists, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and then running `npm install` again.

**Issue:** API requests are failing.

**Solution:** Double-check that your API keys in the `.env` file are correct and that you have enabled the necessary APIs in your cloud provider account.
